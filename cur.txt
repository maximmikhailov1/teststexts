1. Which port state will switch ports immediately transition to when configured for PortFast?
	**forwarding
	blocking
	listening
	learning


2. After the election of the root bridge has been completed, how will switches find the best paths to the root bridge?
	Each switch will analyze the port states of all neighbors and use the designated ports to forward traffic to the root.
	**Each switch will analyze the sum of all port costs to reach the root and use the path with the lowest cost.
	Each switch will analyze the sum of the hops to reach the root and use the path with the fewest hops.
	Each switch will analyze the BID of all neighbors to reach the root and use the path through the lowest BID neighbors.

	VLAN ID
	**MAC address
	extended system ID

5. During the implementation of Spanning Tree Protocol, all switches are rebooted by the network administrator. What is the first step of the spanning-tree election process?
	**All the switches send out BPDUs advertising themselves as the root bridge.
	Each switch determines the best path to forward traffic.
	Each switch determines what port to block to prevent a loop from occurring.
	Each switch with a lower root ID than its neighbor will not send BPDUs.

8. When PVST is running over a switched network, which port state can participate in BPDU frame forwarding based on BPDUs received, but does not forward data frames?
	disabled
	forwarding
	**listening
	blocking


9. Which STP port role is adopted by a switch port if there is no other port with a lower cost to the root bridge?
	designated port
	alternate

10. Which two statements describe a switch port that is configured with PortFast? (Choose two.)
	The switch port immediately transitions from the listening to the forwarding state.
	**The switch port immediately transitions from blocking to the forwarding state.
	The switch port sends DHCP requests before transitioning to the forwarding state.
	The switch port immediately processes any BPDUs before transitioning to the forwarding state.
	**The switch port should never receive BPDUs.


11. What is one way to correct a spanning tree failure?
	Replace the cables on failed STP links.
	**Manually remove redundant links in the switched network.
	Insert redundant links to replace the failed STP links.
	Replace all instances of STP with RSTP.


12. What additional information is contained in the 12-bit extended system ID of a BPDU?
	port ID
	MAC address
	IP address
	**VLAN ID


13. An administrator is troubleshooting a switch and wants to verify if it is a root bridge. What command can be used to do this?
	**show spanning-tree
	show running-config
	show vlan
	show startup-config


14. What is an accurate description of redundancy?
	designing a network to use multiple virtual devices to ensure that all traffic uses the best path through the internetwork
	configuring a router with a complete MAC address database to ensure that all frames can be forwarded to the correct destination
	**designing a network to use multiple paths between switches to ensure there is no single point of failure
	configuring a switch with proper security to ensure that all traffic forwarded through an interface is filtered


15. Which three components are combined to form a bridge ID? (Choose three.)
	**Bridge priority
	Cost
	**Extended system ID
	IP address
	**MAC address
	Port ID


16. What is an advantage of PVST+?
	PVST+ optimizes performance on the network through automatic selection of the root bridge.
	**PVST+ optimizes performance on the network through load sharing using multiple root bridges.
	PVST+ reduces bandwidth consumption compared to traditional implementations of STP that use CST.
	PVST+ requires fewer CPU cycles for all the switches in the network.


17. In which two port states does a switch learn MAC addresses and process BPDUs in a PVST network? (Choose two.)
	Blocking
	Disabled
	**Forwarding
	**Learning
	Listening


18. What two features does Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) provide to ensure proper network operations? (Choose two.)
	Implementing VLANs to contain broadcasts
	Link-state dynamic routing that provides redundant routes
	**Redundant links between Layer 2 switches
	**Removing single points of failure with multiple Layer 2 switches
	Static default routes


19. Which PVST+ feature ensures that configured switch edge ports do not cause Layer 2 loops if a port is mistakenly connected to another switch?
	**BPDU guard
	Extended system ID
	PortFast
	PVST+


20. What is an advantage of using STP in a LAN?
	It combines multiple switch trunk links into a logical port channel link to increase bandwidth.
	It decreases the size of the failure domain.
	It provides firewall services to protect the LAN.
	**It temporarily disables redundant paths to stop Layer 2 loops.


21. Which two statements regarding a PortFast enabled switch port are true? (Choose two.)
	**The port immediately transitions from blocking to forwarding state.
	The port immediately transitions from listening to forwarding state.
	The port immediately processes any BPDUs before transitioning to the forwarding state.
	The port sends DHCP requests before transitioning to the forwarding state.
	**The port should never receive BPDUs.
